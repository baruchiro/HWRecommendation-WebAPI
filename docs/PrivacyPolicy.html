<p>
  It is CompuTEach's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
  may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CompuTeach-536528390204202/"

  (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
  "https://www.facebook.com/CompuTeach-536528390204202/"). We respect your
  privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information
  you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy
  ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our
  Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may
  disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to
  information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our
  collection of information from other sources.
</p>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our
  Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our
  Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you may be
  required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
</p>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
<p>
  Like most website operators, CompuTEach collects non-personally-identifying
  information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
  available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and
  the date and time of each visitor request. CompuTEach's purpose in collecting
  non-personally identifying information is to better understand how
  CompuTEach's visitors use its website. From time to time, CompuTEach may
  release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
  publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p>
<p>
  CompuTEach also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
  Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
  comments on https://www.facebook.com/CompuTeach-536528390204202/ blog posts.
  CompuTEach only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the
  same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
  information as described below.
</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>
  Certain visitors to CompuTEach's websites choose to interact with CompuTEach
  in ways that require CompuTEach to gather personally-identifying information.
  The amount and type of information that CompuTEach gathers depends on the
  nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog
  at https://www.facebook.com/CompuTeach-536528390204202/ to provide a username
  and email address.
</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
<p>
  CompuTEach discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
  and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order
  to process it on CompuTEach's behalf or to provide services available at
  CompuTEach's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others.
  Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be
  located outside of your home country; by using CompuTEach's website, you
  consent to the transfer of such information to them. CompuTEach will not rent
  or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
  information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
  organizations, as described above, CompuTEach discloses potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response
  to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when CompuTEach
  believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
  property or rights of CompuTEach, third parties or the public at large.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a registered user of
  https://www.facebook.com/CompuTeach-536528390204202/ and have supplied your
  email address, CompuTEach may occasionally send you an email to tell you about
  new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's
  going on with CompuTEach and our products. We primarily use our blog to
  communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email
  to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via
  one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order
  to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other
  users. CompuTEach takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against
  the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
<p>
  Although most changes are likely to be minor, CompuTEach may change its
  Privacy Policy from time to time, and in CompuTEach's sole discretion.
  CompuTEach encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes
  to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in
  this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
